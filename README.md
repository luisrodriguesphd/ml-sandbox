# ðŸ§  ml-sandbox

This repository contains practical experiments and studies on core Machine Learning concepts, including regression, classification, regularization, feature transformations, and model evaluation.

Each experiment is organized in its own folder with an explanatory `README.md` and executable Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“‚ Available Experiments
[Back to ToC](#toc)

- `/asyncio-concurrency-basics`: Six minimal Python asyncio examples showing sequential vs concurrent execution with TaskGroup (3.11+) and gather, plus error-handling, task dependencies, and queue-based optimization patterns; includes timings and notes on structured concurrency. This one complements ML service work by clarifying async I/O issues.

- `/linear-regression-feature-scaling`: Investigates the impact of feature scaling and nonlinear transformations on linear regression models, with and without regularization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
[Back to ToC](#toc)

To provide a well-structured and hands-on space for testing hypotheses, validating theoretical concepts, and sharing insights related to traditional machine learning (excluding deep learning for now).
