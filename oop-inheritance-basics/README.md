# OOP Inheritance Basics

Minimal, focused examples demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming concepts through practical Python code:

1. `01_basic_inheritance.py` — demonstrates single inheritance with a simple class hierarchy.
2. `02_multiple_inheritance.py` — explores multiple inheritance and method resolution order (MRO).
3. `03_method_override.py` — shows method overriding and the use of `super()`.
4. `04_abstract_classes.py` — implements abstract base classes and enforced interfaces.
5. `05_interfaces_protocols.py` — demonstrates Python's approach to interfaces using protocols.
6. `06_mixin_patterns.py` — illustrates the mixin pattern for code reuse.
7. `07_property_inheritance.py` — explores property inheritance and descriptor patterns.

> Context: This experiment complements the project by providing clear, practical examples of OOP concepts that are fundamental to well-structured software design. Each example builds upon previous concepts while remaining independently executable.

## Goals

- Understand inheritance hierarchies and their practical applications
- Compare different inheritance patterns (single vs multiple)
- Learn proper method overriding and super() usage
- Explore abstract classes and interface implementations
- Master property inheritance and descriptor patterns
- Practice mixin-based code reuse

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (all examples should work on modern Python versions)
- No third-party packages required
- Basic understanding of Python classes and objects

---

## Project Structure

```yaml

## How to Run

From this folder:

```bash
# Run basic inheritance example
python 01_basic_inheritance.py

# Run multiple inheritance example
python 02_multiple_inheritance.py

# Run method override example
python 03_method_override.py

# Run abstract classes example
python 04_abstract_classes.py

# Run interfaces and protocols example
python 05_interfaces_protocols.py

# Run mixin patterns example
python 06_mixin_patterns.py

# Run property inheritance example
python 07_property_inheritance.py
```

The examples provide clear console output demonstrating the concepts in action.
